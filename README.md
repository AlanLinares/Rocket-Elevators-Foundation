# README

This week's assignment is an extension of our full Rocket Elevators project. We've added an interventions table and web form for a user to add interventions to the table. Upon creating an intervention a ticket is created in FreshDesk for an admin to review. 

###Installation

******IMPORTANT******  
WE NEED TO INSTALL RUBY VERSION 2.7.6 

WE ALSO NEED TO INSTALL RAILS VERSION 5.2.7


Please remember this when following the installation guides

   *********IMPORTANT*********

If you are using a Windows computer then you will need to install Unbuntu to run the code and install the other things we need

On windows we first need to install WSL2
https://www.howtogeek.com/744328/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-on-windows-11/   **use this link to install WSL on Windows 11**

https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10 **use this link to install WSL on Windows 10**

Then download and install Unbuntu

After installing Unbuntu we follow this guide to install Ruby and Rails 
https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/22.04

After installing Rails you can use this link to download and install MySQL
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-22-04

**If you are using a Mac computer you don't need Unbuntu.** You can follow this installation guide to install Ruby, Rails and MySQL.

The installation guide for both Windows and Mac computers will also have a guide to configure your github account. 
 
## Testing the webpage

Once everything is installed and the MySQL service and Rails server have been started, you can go to localhost:3000 on any browser to test the webpage. 

## Weekly Update
With the addition of this week's code a user is now able to make interventions from the webpage. When a building's battery, column and/or elevator is not working, we can add the broken item to a list for management. A ticket is also created in FreshDesk for a manager.
